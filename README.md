## 🌍 Hello, world! And greetings, fellow coder or recruiter! 👋
Welcome aboard my GitHub time machine! 🕰️✨ Settle in, and let me give you a tour of my code journey. Grab some ☕️ and enjoy the ride!

### 🇺🇦 **Origin: Kharkiv, Ukraine**
*This is where it all began...*  
- 🖥️ My first computer  
- 👨‍💻 My first line of code and repository  
- 🐛 My first bug  
- 💾 First commit & pull request  
- 🎓 First bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from **Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics**.

### 🌌 **Exploring My GitHub Universe**
My GitHub captures milestones, learnings, and challenges. It's more than code; it's a snapshot of my journey. 🚀

- 📅 **2019**: My first end-to-end project with UI/UX, backend, algorithms, and visualizations - [bstree-tango](link_here).
  
- 🕰️ **Pandemic Era**: Developed a PWA to help me (and others) keep track of sporadic online classes in Spain - [pwa-timetable](link_here).

- 📅 **2021**: Bachelor's thesis representing a smart drone system with road quality and state image recognition IOT - [rdrone-back](link_here).

- 📅 **2022**: Dive into my research projects - [q-learning](link_here) & [semi-supervised-regression](link_here).

- 🔐 **Crypto Projects**: Current explorations include [crypto-news](link_here) & [crypto-tradin](link_here).

### 🔭 **Focus & Interests**
Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP) have captivated my heart and mind. The potential in these branches of machine learning is vast, and I'm all in!

### 🧰 **Professional Toolkit**
- **Languages**: Python, GoLang, C++, SQL
- **Technologies**: Databricks, PySpark, Hive, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PostgreSQL, NoSQL (Redis)
- **Tools**: gRPC, REST, Docker, Terraform, Bash, AWS

### 🌟 **A Bit More About Me**
I bring nearly 2 years of experience in the crypto sphere, working as a backend developer, primarily with GoLang. I then transitioned into the CRM domain for a year, giving me a robust understanding of micro-service architectures. While I've delved into multiple languages professionally, Python remains my true love ❤️. The highlight of Summer 2023? My ML internship with the **Volvo Group**.
