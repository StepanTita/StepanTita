### 🌌 **Exploring My GitHub Universe**
My GitHub captures milestones, learnings, and challenges. It's more than code; it's a snapshot of my journey. 🚀

- 📅 **2019**: My first end-to-end project with UI/UX, backend, algorithms, and visualizations - [bstree-tango](https://github.com/StepanTita/bstree-tango).
  
- 🕰️ **Pandemic Era**: Developed a PWA to help me (and others) keep track of sporadic online classes in Spain - [pwa-timetable](https://github.com/StepanTita/pwa-timetable/tree/pwa-dev).

- 📅 **2021**: Bachelor's thesis representing a smart drone system with road quality and state image recognition IOT - [rdrone-back](https://github.com/StepanTita/rdrone-back). And research paper on fine-tuning transformers for Ukrainian Language [news-contest](https://github.com/StepanTita/news-contest)

- 📅 **2022**: Dive into my research projects - [q-learning](https://github.com/StepanTita/q-learning) & [semi-supervised-regression](https://github.com/StepanTita/semi-supervised-regression).

- 🔐 **Crypto Projects**: Current explorations include [crypto-news](https://github.com/StepanTita/crypto-news) & [crypto-trading](https://github.com/StepanTita/crypto-trading).

### 🔭 **Focus & Interests**
Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP) have captivated my heart and mind. The potential in these branches of machine learning is vast, and I'm all in!

### 🧰 **Professional Toolkit**
- **Languages**: Python, GoLang, C++, SQL
- **Technologies**: Databricks, PySpark, Hive, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PostgreSQL, NoSQL (Redis, Mongo)
- **Tools**: gRPC, REST, Docker, Terraform, Bash, AWS

### 🌟 **A Bit More About Me**
I bring nearly 2 years of experience in the crypto sphere, working as a backend developer, primarily with GoLang. I then transitioned into the CRM domain for a year, giving me a robust understanding of micro-service architectures. While I've delved into multiple languages professionally, **Python** remains my true love ❤️. 
The highlight of Summer 2023? My ML/DS internship with the **Volvo Group**.
